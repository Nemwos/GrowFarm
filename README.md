# **GrowFarm – Crop, Fertilizer and Plant Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**
A simple ML and DL based website made with Streamlit which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops.

DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This is a proof-of-concept (POC) project. The developer provides no assurance for the data used here. As a result, don't use it to make farming judgments. If you do this, the designer is not liable for anything. This project, on the other hand, illustrates the idea of how we can apply ML/DL in precision farming if developed on a large scale and with real and confirmed data.
